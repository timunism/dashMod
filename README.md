# DashMod
Licensed Dashboard add-ons for Laravel &amp; Filament.

# About
This is the official distribution repo for the dashModProject (which itself is proprietary).
DashMod allows a Laravel project to synchronize Themes (e.g. Dark & Light mode) across different
project plugins, such as Filament & JetStream.

What this means is, Filament triggered Dark/Light mode can be extended to JetStream and all other
Laravel boilerplate components with zero-overhead.
