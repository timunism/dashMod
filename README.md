# DashMod
Licensed Dashboard add-ons for Laravel &amp; Filament.

# About
This is the official distribution repo for the dashModProject (which itself is proprietary).
DashMod allows a Laravel Filament project to synchronize Themes (e.g. Dark & Light mode) across different
project plugins, such as JetStream.

What this means is, Filament triggered Dark/Light mode can be extended to JetStream and all other
Laravel boilerplate components with zero-overhead.

# How Does It Work
DashMod overwrites the default JetStream color-scheme, which is by-default dependent on the Browser,
and add styling that is dependent on the Filament theme instead.

This results in uniform styling between Filament panels & JetStream components, allowing the application
to transition between the two, while maintaining a similar color accent, scheme, & palette as well (optional).

# NOTE
DashMod requires private source code to work out-of-the-box.
